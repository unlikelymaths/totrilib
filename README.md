## Install

Totrilib in only tested on Linux,
but should also work on Windows.

### Docker

Make sure you have
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
and 
[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)
installed.
Download NVIDIA Optix (7.2.0) from
<https://developer.nvidia.com/designworks/optix/downloads/legacy>
and extract to `extern/NVIDIA-OptiX-SDK-7.2.0`,
and make sure you have [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11)
in `extern/pybind11`.
The easiest way to run totrilib is to use
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
and start a detached container with
`docker compose up -d`.
Otherwise see `docker-compose.yml` for settings to start a container.
Mount additional volumes as needed.

### Standard

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed.
The suggested versions should work fine, but others might also do.

- CMake (3.21.1)
- NVIDIA CUDA (11.1) and NVIDIA driver (470.57.02)
- NVIDIA Optix (7.2.0)  
  Download from
  <https://developer.nvidia.com/designworks/optix/downloads/legacy>.
  Make sure to set environment variable `OptiX_INSTALL_DIR` to your install
  directory or install in `extern/NVIDIA-OptiX-SDK-7.2.0`.
- pybind11  
  Download from <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11> to `extern/pybind11`
- Python (3.7.10)
- Pytorch (1.9.0)

Install with pip (`pip install /path/to/totrilib`).

## Samples

Code will follow soon.

To run the sample code, various data files are required.
For the *Statue*, *Diffuse S*, *Mannequin* and the *Zaragoza Bunny*
we refer to the respective publications listed below.
Adjust the paths in the sample files as needed.
